        <p> This is the Website for the National AI Student Challenge 2022. We have used PeekingDuck as our core tool for Computer Vision. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as of now, it can only support one connection due to computing constraints. The website supports both Desktop and Mobile access to work as an exercise aid.</p>
        <p> We currently support 3 exercises: Side Squats, Front Squats, and Side Push-Ups. For best training results, please time each rep at about 2-3s.</p>
        <p>Additionally, please ensure that the camera can see your whole body, especially your feet.</p>
